# An Application About Based Data

Our application will allow users to create and share top ten lists for various forms of media including movies, songs, and animes. Additionally, we plan to allow users to browse other usersâ€™ public lists and view trending media that other users have in their lists. Data will be taken from publicly available datasets, including the IMDb dataset, a manga dataset from Kaggle, an anime dataset from Kaggle, and a video game dataset provided on Kaggle.

## Figure Out What Tech Stack to Describe

We will use the cloud hosting service Vercel to host our PostgreSQL database along with our web-based user interface, built using Next.js. The interface will have a search bar in the main page, allowing users to search for any movie, song, anime, or game that is included within our datasets to create a top ten list. Once a user selects something, the search bar will automatically show more options from the same media type for the user to continue to add to their top ten list. Users will have the option to view, update and share their lists under their profiles. There will be a separate section where users will be able to search for other profiles and lists.
